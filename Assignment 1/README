* This program reads in a set of points from a text file,
  and calculates the closest pair of points and its distance.


* By using two algorithms for comparison:
  1. Brute Force --> O(n^2)
  2. Divide-and-Conquer --> O(nlog(n)) 


* To run the program through the command line, use the following command:
  	$python3 --algorithm a dataset1.txt

	Note) --algorithm a   to test both BruteForce and Divide&Conquer
	      --algorithm b   to test only BruteForce
	      --algorithm d   to test only Divide&Conquer

	Exec. ex) C:\Users\sH\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\python.exe 
		      C:\Users\sH\Desktop\nearestNeighbor.py --algorithm a 
		          C:\Users\sH\Desktop\dataset1.txt
